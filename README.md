# BikeRentalPredict

This project works with data set containing data about bike rentals in a large European city.
The main learning task for this data set is predicting the amount of bikes rented (by subscribers to the service and by non-subscribers) based on the other features in the data set. This repository displays most important findings, and what can learn be from them.

This report file/document contains the analysis of a dataset for bike rentals depending on time and weather features. Then, different predictors including a linear regression model, SVM and a decision tree regressor predictor are implemented in order to predict the number of rentals based on the input features. Also, dimensionality reduction and unsupervised machine learning techniques, among other machine learning strategies, are studied. Finally, The analysis of the data, experiments and conclusions are presented.
